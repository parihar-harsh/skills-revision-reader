# Skills Revision Reader

A static, navigable revision interface for 408 questions represented in relevant GeeksforGeeks interview-question collections, organized into 17 resume-technology categories. It includes all 50 numbered questions from the linked GFG GenAI collection and all 61 numbered headings currently present in the GFG DevOps collection, with original concise answers and examples. The DevOps source itself skips number 28, so the reader preserves that source numbering instead of inventing a question.

The deployment also includes `roadmap.html`, a focused AI / GenAI Engineer route personalized for a fresher who already knows DSA/OOP, JavaScript/TypeScript, React/Next.js, Node/Express/REST APIs, SQL/NoSQL databases, AWS/Cloudflare, Docker/Kubernetes and Git but is starting Python and AI from zero. It contains 54 essential videos (22 hours 19 minutes) and 9 optional interview-depth videos, for 30 hours 11 minutes in Full coverage. CampusX and Krish Naik provide 35 of the 63 videos and more than 72% of the total watch time. CampusX is the primary source where its verified content directly matches the lesson; focused specialist creators remain where they provide missing, newer or substantially more concise coverage. Resources are mostly Hindi/Hinglish, with labeled English fallbacks only for focused production topics. Exact watch segments keep long Python, Pandas, LangChain and agent videos focused. Nine build checkpoints cover Python services, minimum hands-on classical ML, application-level LLM fundamentals, model APIs, prompt engineering, production RAG, agents, FastAPI, evaluation regression, observability, caching, cost control, reliability and security. Query rewriting, HyDE, multi-query expansion and two-stage reranking are in the core route; Corrective RAG and Self-RAG are optional advanced implementations after LangGraph. Open-source model inference, detailed transformer internals, MCP and LoRA/QLoRA awareness remain optional. Research, foundation-model training, data science, computer vision and advanced MLOps are deliberately excluded.

The route defaults to Full coverage and presents an explicit three-phase sequence across foundations, system building, and production readiness. Every video has a stable lesson number, each module ends with its checkpoint, and the next-lesson panel shows the learner's exact route position. Search, Fast track/Full coverage filters, completed-item filtering, remaining-time estimates, responsive layouts, dark mode and browser-saved progress make the page usable as a self-contained study and practice sequence rather than only a link collection.

`live-coding.html` adds a searchable, role-filtered set of 20 broad practical patterns derived from candidate-reported live coding, machine coding, and timed interview tasks in frontend, backend, databases, DevOps, and CS fundamentals. It opens with the 15 recurring patterns; five plausible but role-specific exercises stay behind the `All verified` filter instead of inflating the default study path. `Learn` mode explains only the concepts required for each implementation with inline examples, while `Quick` mode keeps a compact recall checklist and working reference. The page also includes a reusable six-step interview execution method. Interview-experience and GeeksforGeeks sources remain recorded in `live-coding-data.js`; take-home assignments, broad theory dumps, speculative tasks, and DSA problems are excluded.

The reader defaults to 356 high-frequency questions and can switch to the complete question bank. It runs entirely in the browser. Reviewed progress, theme, mode, frequency, position, active section, search, expanded questions, revealed answers, and scroll position are saved automatically in browser storage. Nothing is uploaded, and no database or account is required.

Resume-aligned role filters group the same verified questions for SDE I, frontend/React, backend/Node.js, full-stack JavaScript, MERN, and DevOps positions. Selecting a role does not duplicate or invent questions.

Questions from the role-based collections are included only when they match the resume technologies. Questions about unrelated stacks such as Angular, Vue, Django, PHP, Spring, and Redux are excluded.

Question wording is normalized for quick revision, while answers and examples are concise original explanations of the GFG-listed concepts.
