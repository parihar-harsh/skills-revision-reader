# Skills Revision Reader

A static, navigable revision interface for 408 questions represented in relevant GeeksforGeeks interview-question collections, organized into 17 resume-technology categories. It includes all 50 numbered questions from the linked GFG GenAI collection and all 61 numbered headings currently present in the GFG DevOps collection, with original concise answers and examples. The DevOps source itself skips number 28, so the reader preserves that source numbering instead of inventing a question.

The deployment also includes `roadmap.html`, a focused AI / GenAI Engineer route for freshers who meet the syllabus's Python, Git and command-line prerequisites but are starting AI from zero. `Syllabus.md` is the topic boundary; the page reorganizes those topics into a dependency-based learning path instead of copying its publishing schedule. It contains 65 direct YouTube videos: 55 technical lessons (30 hours 50 minutes) and 10 interview/career lessons, for 37 hours 2 minutes with Include career enabled. Resources are mostly Hindi/Hinglish; English fallbacks are labeled and used only where topic-by-topic CampusX searches found no suitable direct lesson. The speech-to-text video is marked as a project bridge required by the interview-coach capstone. Transformer and attention mathematics, backpropagation, gradient descent, loss functions, foundation-model training, heavy RLHF/DPO, distributed training, CNNs, RNNs and classical deep-learning detours remain excluded as specified by the syllabus.

The route defaults to Include career and follows prerequisites: LLM concepts, reliable APIs, prompt systems, RAG construction, retrieval improvement, RAG evaluation, tool calling, LangGraph, multi-agent/MCP, production assurance, serving, interview preparation and applications. Technical only ends after deployment. Each section shows what it requires, the concepts to learn, direct lessons, practical build tasks, proof to retain and a locked build check. Search, completed-item filtering, remaining-time estimates, responsive layouts, dark mode and browser-saved progress make the page usable as a self-contained study and practice sequence rather than only a link collection.

`live-coding.html` adds a searchable, role-filtered set of 20 broad practical patterns derived from candidate-reported live coding, machine coding, and timed interview tasks in frontend, backend, databases, DevOps, and CS fundamentals. It opens with the 15 recurring patterns; five plausible but role-specific exercises stay behind the `All verified` filter instead of inflating the default study path. `Learn` mode explains only the concepts required for each implementation with inline examples, while `Quick` mode keeps a compact recall checklist and working reference. The page also includes a reusable six-step interview execution method. Interview-experience and GeeksforGeeks sources remain recorded in `live-coding-data.js`; take-home assignments, broad theory dumps, speculative tasks, and DSA problems are excluded.

The reader defaults to 356 high-frequency questions and can switch to the complete question bank. It runs entirely in the browser. Reviewed progress, theme, mode, frequency, position, active section, search, expanded questions, revealed answers, and scroll position are saved automatically in browser storage. Nothing is uploaded, and no database or account is required.

Resume-aligned role filters group the same verified questions for SDE I, frontend/React, backend/Node.js, full-stack JavaScript, MERN, and DevOps positions. Selecting a role does not duplicate or invent questions.

Questions from the role-based collections are included only when they match the resume technologies. Questions about unrelated stacks such as Angular, Vue, Django, PHP, Spring, and Redux are excluded.

Question wording is normalized for quick revision, while answers and examples are concise original explanations of the GFG-listed concepts.
